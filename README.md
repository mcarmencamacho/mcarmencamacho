## Hi, I'm Carmen! 👋

🔭 I work in Digital Marketing | Game & Software Localization  
🌱 I’m currently learning Web Design and Full Stack Development while working full-time    
💡 I enjoy building things that look good and work well  
🌍 Based in Japan | 🇪🇸 Originally from Spain  
⚡ Fun fact: I speak 3 languages (🇪🇸🇬🇧🇯🇵) and I'm learning Chinese 🇨🇳. Also, I'm a certified Tea Product Specialist 🍵.

### 🛠️ Currently learning (April-June2025):
- HTML & CSS: Slowly taming the cascade monster
- Git & GitHub basics: Learning version control by doing
- Responsive layout techniques
- JavaScript: Dusting off my math brain (I studied literature)

### 📌 Now
- Finishing The Odin Project's Foundations track
- Practicing flexbox layouts and responsive design
- Drinking way too much green tea 🍵

### 🎯 My goals:
- Build a strong foundation in web design and full-stack web development
- Create a portfolio of simple but meaningful projects
- Learn to write clean, maintainable code

### 🚧 Projects I'm working on:
- [Odin Recipes](https://github.com/mcarmencamacho/odin-recipes/) – my first HTML & CSS project. Keeping it up to show how I started and how I’ll grow.
- A simple travel app that helps visitors find meaningful spots and hidden gems (getting to this slowly but steadyly!)
